## Instant Cloud Scale, No Matter What You Deploy

Just Add Water (jaw) is a template repo designed to Securely and Reliably deploy any and all of your services with no additional effort from you.  By offloading provisioning and initial deployments here, it is possible to build an environment where a [Homogenous Infrastructure](link) requires no additional work.  This approach promotes management, maintainability, and security to be first class citizens in a codebase without distracting from important application features.

## Reliable Automation

jaw applies DevOps best practices to ensure that take you to production with confidence.

## Secure By Design

jaw applies defense in depth to existing codebases to establish a secure baseline and improve your security posture with every deployment.

## Dependencies

We ship jaw in a VSCode dev container.  This means you only need to install the following:

- Docker

- VSCode

- [Remote Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

You can then just do `code .` in the top level of this repo and follow VSCode's prompts to get a clean environment.  The first time you do this will take a couple
minutes while it builds your environment.

If you would prefer a purely native environment, you can install the following dependencies:

- [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

- kubectl - `az aks install-cli`
